//! Deterministic test triggers for the `tenuto` binary (design doc M5,
//! implementation decision 8): process tests that need a panic at an exact
//! stage, or a probe on fd 2, cannot arrange that from outside the child
//! process. Instead the child reads `TENUTO_TEST_HOOK` once at startup and
//! a handful of call sites ask whether *they* are the requested stage.
//!
//! Absent or unrecognised values are indistinguishable from `None`: a typo
//! in the environment variable must never silently change which stage a
//! production run behaves like, so anything that is not one of the exact
//! kebab-case names below disables every hook rather than guessing.
