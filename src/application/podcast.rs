//! Resolves which URL to play for a queued podcast episode (M5 plan, Task
//! 10): the local subscription and feed-cache files only, never the
//! network and never an implicit refresh. A queued episode carries its
//! persisted identity ([`MediaId::PodcastEpisode`]) plus a saved fallback
//! enclosure URL; this module decides between the cache's current
//! enclosure and that fallback, by identity alone — never by title, index
//! or date, since a feed can be reordered or partially retained between
//! queueing and playback.
