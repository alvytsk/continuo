//! Binding parsed feed items to subscription-scoped episode identities
//! (§2.4).
//!
//! [`bind_feed`] is the join `tests/m4_feed_parse.rs`'s pure parser
//! deliberately does not perform: it takes the `FeedId` only the
//! subscription layer holds, plus a [`ParseReport`], and produces real
//! [`crate::media::id::MediaId::PodcastEpisode`] identities. It calls
//! [`crate::media::id::EpisodeKey::resolve`] exactly as M0 wrote it —
//! unmodified — and is otherwise infallible: every failure mode it can
//! encounter is an item-level skip-and-warn, never an `Err`.
