//! Transport mappings for tap blocks (spec §10, decision 18).
//!
//! The output callback labels every tap block with `(instance, generation,
//! epoch)` and knows nothing about sessions. Before the playback worker lets
//! a transport run, it publishes the [`TapMapping`] that ties that label to
//! the `session_rev` and output format; the analysis worker looks every
//! block up here and discards what it cannot map.
//!
//! The registry lives behind a mutex and is touched only by the playback
//! worker (publish, retire) and the analysis worker (lookup) - never by the
//! audio callback.
