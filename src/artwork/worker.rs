//! A single background worker that resolves and decodes cover art (design
//! doc M5 §9, §11, decision 24): one thread, one latest-wins request slot,
//! and every job run inside [`run_contained`] so a decoder panic becomes an
//! ordinary [`ArtworkError::Panicked`] result instead of taking the process
//! down. A local track's cover is read from its tags or a sibling file; a
//! podcast episode's is downloaded from the feed's `itunes:image` URL
//! through the HTTP service playback already opened. Plain remote URLs have
//! no artwork source and never reach this worker.
