//! Shutdown signals for `play` (design doc M5 §6.5): SIGINT, SIGHUP and
//! SIGTERM are caught rather than left to kill the process outright, so the
//! session can still flush its final checkpoint and release the profile
//! lock before it exits.
//!
//! The listener thread this installs does exactly one thing per signal: it
//! records the first one, flags a shutdown as requested, and wakes anyone
//! polling [`ShutdownSignals::wake`]. It never renders, loads state or
//! flushes — that all still happens on the caller's own thread, in
//! `app::run_resolved_locked`'s ordinary shutdown path.
