//! What the spectrum row shows (design doc M5 §10, decision 25).
//!
//! Analysis runs only while the row exists and playback is `Playing`
//! ([`wants_analysis`]). [`SpectrumDisplay`] holds the drawn levels between
//! frames and is updated before each draw, never inside it: a published
//! frame is drawn only while it is fresh and still belongs to the adopted
//! playback; otherwise the drawn levels decay. The clock check is the view's
//! own, so a worker that is late clearing a stale frame cannot freeze the
//! row.
