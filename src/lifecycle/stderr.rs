//! The per-session TUI log (design doc M5 §11): a uniquely named append log
//! under `<state dir>/logs/`, retention of the five most recent prior logs,
//! and — on Unix — redirecting the process's own fd 2 into it so a panic or
//! a library's stray `eprintln!` lands in the log instead of corrupting the
//! terminal `tui` is drawing to.
//!
//! `open_session_log` and `retain_recent_logs` are exercised directly by
//! `tests/m5_session_log.rs`. `redirect_stderr` is exercised only from a
//! subprocess (Task 29): redirecting fd 2 in-process would also capture the
//! test runner's own stderr.
