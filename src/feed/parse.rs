//! Feed bytes to parse-layer values (§4).
//!
//! [`parse_feed`] is subscription-independent on purpose: it takes bytes and
//! the URL they were retrieved from, and knows nothing about `FeedId`s, caches
//! or the network. That is what makes it testable against fixtures alone.
//!
//! Decoding is an explicit layer, never `NsReader` over raw bytes (§4.1):
//!
//! ```text
//! bytes -> quick_xml::encoding::DecodingReader -> NsReader<DecodingReader<&[u8]>>
//! ```
//!
//! `DecodingReader` transcodes with `decode_to_utf8_without_replacement`, so a
//! malformed byte becomes [`FeedError::Encoding`] rather than U+FFFD. A
//! silently mangled title is worse than a refusal that names its cause.
//!
//! RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 are two mappings over **one** walker (§4.3). The
//! document element picks the mapping once, and from there the format lives in
//! the [`Context`] the open path resolves to: an RSS arm wants an RSS context
//! and the empty namespace, an Atom arm wants an Atom context and the Atom
//! namespace URI. Prefixes never enter into it, and no element can be mistaken
//! for a field of the other format.
